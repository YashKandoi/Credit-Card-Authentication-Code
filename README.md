# Securing Online Transactions for Robust Payment Processing Mechanisms in AI Driven World

## Credit Card Authentication System Using Homomorphic Encryption

A secure credit card authentication system that uses the Paillier homomorphic encryption scheme to protect sensitive transaction data. The system implements three operations (add, subtract, divide) while maintaining data privacy.

## Key Features
- Secure credit card number handling using pseudo-random number generation and SHA-256 hashing
- Paillier homomorphic encryption for encrypted mathematical operations
- Support for addition, subtraction and division operations on encrypted data
- Performance benchmarking with timing measurements for key operations

## Components
- User class: Handles credit card details and generates transaction values
- Retailer class: Processes encrypted transaction data
- Bank class: Manages encryption keys and verifies transactions
- Paillier cryptosystem implementation for homomorphic operations

The system ensures transaction security while allowing mathematical operations on encrypted values, making it suitable for secure payment processing in AI-driven applications.
